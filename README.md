# authTest

I was noticing that google login was being deprecated, so I wanted to mock up an example of how to use Google Identity to login to apps based on the domain that I setup in the google dashboard.

as for the google dashboard, I created a new app, and gave it a scope of auth/userinfo.email, and then just add an OAuth cliend Id.
